<p>AdminRCON is a simple online tool that you can use to access your server using the RCON password and do some
    simple server management without having to log onto the server and type into an ugly console.</p>
<p>The current tasks you can do are:
<ul>
    <li>Change the password</li>
    <li>Execute configs</li>
    <li>Change the map</li>
    <li>Execute custom commands</li>
</ul>
with more features to come!</p>

<p>If you need any help with using the tool, or you find a bug, you can contact the developer on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thermo-Nuclear/">Steam</a>, or message me on Discord <span class="code">Thermite#5512</span></p>
